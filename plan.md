Add pre-commit linter, formatter
* why is there a SQLite database in test? can we utilize postgresql for testing?
* why are 4 tests skipped?

Look at getting a more wholistic example setup

Enable a user to rejoin a codespace after it's been created
* save the link to the codespace in the database rather than spinning up a new one each time

Remove the codespace after question completion

Vs Code plugin to automatically mark questions completed after a successful test run -> api call to mark the question completed

Create repo as needed rather than requiring it to be created in advance
