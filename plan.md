Deploy to render.

Raise test coverage

Look at getting a more wholistic example setup

Figure out how this could be deployed to avoid needing to run on a local machine.

Enable a user to rejoin a codespace after it's been created
* save the link to the codespace in the database rather than spinning up a new one each time

Remove the codespace after question completion

Vs Code plugin to automatically mark questions completed after a successful test run -> api call to mark the question completed

Create repo as needed rather than requiring it to be created in advance
